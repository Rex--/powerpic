## Hardware

**Version 1.1**
- Switched buzzer from RF0 to RG7 so we can use the PWM peripherial
- Switched keypad rows to RA0-RA3. Row 1 was using RA5 which is VBAT and unusable as digital output
- Added additional testpoints for the side buttons, allowing buttons to be simulated for development
- Added additional GND testpoint

**Version 1.0**
 - First hardware version
